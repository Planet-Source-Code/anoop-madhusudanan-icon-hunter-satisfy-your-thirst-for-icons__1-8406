Details 
--------------

Welcome to Icon Hunter, the application for extracting and saving existing icons from multiple executables in your computer.

The story of Icon Hunter is here.  As a visual programmer, for the past few years, I found myself an ever increasing need for icons. Although Icon editing is a pleasure, I can't waste much time on that (because the joy of designing and coding is a little more than that of icon editing :) ).  That is why I took few hours to write this application.  After using it few times, I decided to distribute it freely, after adding some nice features (and a cool easter egg in the about box).
