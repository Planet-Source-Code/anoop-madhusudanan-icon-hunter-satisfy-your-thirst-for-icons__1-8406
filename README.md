### Description

Hi Folks, If you are a Visual Basic programmer, I am almost sure that you are fond of icons. If you are tired of using those old icons, this application (with complete source code) is for you. It is a complete Icon Search application, which allows you to extract icons from executables and Icon libraries.

The story behind this application is interesting. One of the icon designers in my project team (I am presently working as the software manager of Time Technologies,Kerala,India) told me that it will be very helpfull if she can get an application for extracting already existing icons. She can then simply modify it or reuse it, instead of creating all icons from scratch. That is why I took few hours for writing this application.

Hey, one last thing to remember you. Kindly vote for me if this application can satisfy your ever increasing thirst for icons.

Also, I am looking for established US companies to invest in the technologies I developed, including the latest Streaming Audio Technology. If you are a US based developer, kindly visit http://www.geocities.com/streamingaudio if u have enough time, and let me know more about the investors and venture capitalists in US. Regards;
